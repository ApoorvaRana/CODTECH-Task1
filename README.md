## Project Overview
**This project is a simple and interactive to-do list web application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. Users can add tasks with a deadline (date and time), filter tasks by their status (All, Active, Completed, Incomplete), and perform actions such as editing, marking as done, and deleting tasks. This application aims to enhance productivity by helping users keep track of their tasks in a visually appealing and user-friendly way.**

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to build an intuitive task management application where users can efficiently manage their to-do lists. The focus is on simplicity, responsiveness, and providing a seamless user experience.

### Key Activities
- **Task Management:** Users can add tasks with deadlines (date and time), edit tasks, mark them as completed, or delete them.
- **Filtering Options:** Users can filter tasks based on their status: All tasks, Active tasks, Completed tasks, and Incomplete tasks (tasks that are overdue but not completed).
- **Session-Based Task Storage:** The task data is stored in the browser session memory, ensuring user privacy while maintaining an easy-to-use interface.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS:** For building the structure and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript:** For handling user interactions, managing tasks, and applying filters.
- **Session Storage:** To temporarily store tasks during the user session.

### Key Insights
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application features an aesthetically pleasing design with soft gradients, rounded corners, and smooth transitions to enhance the user experience.
- **Filter Functionality:** The application provides filtering options that allow users to focus on specific task categories, such as active tasks or overdue tasks that haven't been completed.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** The tasks update in real-time as users add, edit, or delete them, ensuring an interactive experience without the need for page reloads.

### Applications
This application can be used in daily task management, allowing users to:

- Plan and organize tasks with deadlines.
- Track task progress by marking them as completed.
- Filter tasks to focus on active or overdue items.
- The to-do list app is versatile and can be extended to meet different personal or team task management needs.

### Results
The project successfully demonstrates a fully functional to-do list application with core features like task creation, filtering, editing, and completion. The application provides a simple yet efficient way to manage tasks on the go.

### Conclusion
This to-do list web application serves as a practical tool for personal productivity, helping users manage their tasks in a visually appealing and functional interface. The project showcases fundamental web development skills and can be expanded with additional features such as persistent storage, user authentication, or task categories in future versions.
